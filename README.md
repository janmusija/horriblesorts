# sorting algorithm list

## Algorithms that assume idealized things (e.g. no integer limit -- which can be accomplished by replacing relevant ints with bigints, etcetera)

hydrasort\_bms : uses a really inefficient data structure based on bashicu matrix system. Time complexity roughly $f_{\mathrm{lim}(\mathrm{BMS})}(n)$. May or may not be the slowest sorting algorithm ever explicitly written (with these idealized constraints)
